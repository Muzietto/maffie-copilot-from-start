Muzietto: make an HTML5 index.html file that shows two vertical divs with id
left-column and main-area. main-area is on the right side and it occupies two
thirds of the screen. left-column has a pink border size 2px. main-area has a
blue border size 2px. all the CSS is inside the html file. both divs are as high
as the whole screen.

Muzietto: from now on, when I give you a measure through a pure number, I mean
it as pixels

Muzietto: give a margin 6 to both divs

Muzietto: make 6 the total distance between the two divs

Muzietto: make 8 the width of the borders, with border radius 12

Muzietto: make 6 the left margin of the pink border. make 6 the right margin of
the blue border

Muzietto: place above the page a right horizontal div with id title, width 100%
of the screen and height 10% of the screen. put inside the text "Cippirimerlo".
adjust the height of the two older divs accordingly

Muzietto: put inside title a red border with the same proportions as the pink
and blue borders

Muzietto: make 6 the top margin, the left margin and the right margin of the red
border

Muzietto: left-column must occupy 20% of the screen width. adjust main-area
accordingly

Muzietto: adjust the texts inside left-column and main-area to reflect the
changes in width you just made

Muzietto: from now on I don't care about your todo list. just managet it
yourself

Muzietto: put four thumbnails in the left column above the text. each thumbnail
has the proportions of the main-area and displays one of the four svg files
inside the svgs directory. each thumbnail has width 80% of the left column

Muzietto: put a colored border with width 4 around each thumbnail. choose the
colors yourself

Muzietto: give padding 4 to the thumbnails

Muzietto: remove the text from main-area. place a canvas with id main-canvas,
margin 10, green border width 4 and border radius 6 inside main-area.

Muzietto: make the thumbnails clickable, with a hovering text that shows the
name of the file inside. when I click on a thumbnail make a console log that
says "You clicked" and the name of the thumbnail.

Muzietto: remove the file extension from the hovering texts and from the logs

Muzietto: when I click a thumbnail, draw the svg file inside the main canvas
transforming the vectors into canvas draw instructions. give the canvas border
the same color of the thumbnail border. show me exactly everything you are doing
and tell me whether you encounter problems

Muzietto: when I resize the screen I want the canvas redrawn

Muzietto: put a padding 8 to the main canvas

Muzietto: when the page starts I want the first thumbnail selected and its
content drawn in the main canvas

Muzietto: when a thumbnail is selected I want its border to have double width

Muzietto: when a thumbnail is selected I want its background color to be light
grey

Muzietto: remove the text from the left column

Muzietto: extract all the CSS from the html file and put it inside a style.css.
link the css file from the html file

Muzietto: move the style.css file inside a css directory

Muzietto: extract the javascript code that handles the main canvas and put it
inside a file canvas,js

Muzietto: extract the js code that handles the thumbnails and put it inside a
thumbnails.js file

Muzietto: move the js files inside a js directory

Muzietto: i want you to reorganize the code of canvas.js into an IIFE

Muzietto: I don't want resizeMainCanvas and drawSvgOnCanvas in the global scope.
i want the iife to expose an API called MAFFIE that allows to execute the two
functions. thumbnails.js must access the MAFFIE API when it needs the two
functions

Muzietto: inside canvas.js I don't want the iife to depend explicitly on window
and document. create two global variables W and D before the iife and let the
iife use them

Muzietto: format all html, css and js files in this project to use an indent of
two spaces

Muzietto: there is a localhost server on port 8080. you may use that for your
tests if you need it

Muzietto: inside canvas.js move _lastSvgText and its setter/getter inside the
MAFFIE object

Muzietto: move the debounce function and every other helper function inside a
new utils.js file inside the js directory

Muzietto: mention the UTILS object inside the readme

Muzietto: are you able to send files out to a ftp endpoint?

Muzietto: I need you to prepare a script that uses SFTP

Muzietto: please modify the upload_sftp_dir.py script. add lines at the
beginning where I can set the following parameters: host, username, password,
local-dir, remote-dir.

Muzietto: add to upload_sftp_dir also a parameter to define the port

Muzietto: what is the fallback value when DEFAULT_LOCAL_DIR is not set?

Muzietto: use the current project root directory as fallback

Muzietto: add a parameter DEFAULT_ALLOW_MISSING_HOST_KEY in the script. when it
is True, the script will add the --allow-missing-host-key flag to the paramiko
invocation

Muzietto: i want a whitelist. patch the script to allow a list of strings
DEFAULT_FILE_EXTENSIONS_TO_UPLOAD containing the file extensions that must be
uploaded. the script will scan the root directory and upload all the files with
extensions inside the list. each uploaded file will be obviously inside the
correct directory.

Muzietto: i want the script to empty the DEFAULT_REMOTE_DIR directory before
starting to upload files

Muzietto: Keep whitelist but also remove empty remote directories after upload

Muzietto: add a DEFAULT_SKIP_DIRS parameter to the script to exclude directories
from   the os.walk loop. 

Muzietto: when the svg files are drawn in the main canvas, they are all correct
except one: file butterfly.svg contains violet entities, but the version drawn
in the main canvas uses only black color. please draw in violet also in the main
canvas.

Muzietto: add a file selector titled "Immagine Addizionale" at the bottom of the
left column. it allows the user to pick an image file from the desktop. when the
image is chosen it must be drawn as background in the main canvas. the image
must be scaled to fill the canvas dimensions.

Muzietto: add a button "Rimuovi Immagine" to clear the file input and to remove
the image from the main canvas

Muzietto: I want the button to be disabled when no image is loaded

Muzietto: align horizontally the "rimuovi immagine" button exactly under the
file upload button 

Muzietto: add a button labeled "Scarica Immagine" at the bottom of the left
column. when it is pressed a png copy of the main canvas is created and
downloaded on the desktop

Muzietto: align horizontally the last button with the other two. put a margin
top 16 above the last button

Muzietto: make 24 the gap bove the last button

Muzietto: add a nice horizontal slider with id "additional-image-scaler" under
the "choose file" button

Muzietto: now use the scaler to scale the dimentions of the background image in
the canvas. the current initial value of the slider corresponds to the initial
dimensions of the background image in the canvas. as the user changes the slider
value, the background image in the canvas is redrawn in real time. moving the
slider left means "zoom out". moving the slider right means "zoom in"

Muzietto: the slider must be disabled when no image file is selected

Muzietto: use the upload script to upload the project as it is now

Muzietto: change the "cippirimerlo" text into "Marco Copilot" and align it on
the left

Muzietto: enlarge "Marco Copilot" text size so to fill exactly the vertical
dimension of the red bordered div

Muzietto: use the upload script to upload the project as it is now

Muzietto: adjust the media query for a smartphone in portrait orientation.
reduce the "marco copilot" text size and put all the thumbnails two per row

Muzietto: when the user brings the mouse on the main canvas, the cursor changes
to "grab". while the user clicks the mouse on the main canvas the cursor changes
to "grabbing"

Muzietto: the grab/grabbing cursor changes on the main canvas must be performed
only when the "immagine addizionale" file has been chosen. if no image file has
been chosen, the cursor on the main canvas must remain as before.

Muzietto: when a background image is chosen and the user is clicking on the
canvas (i.e. the cursor is in "grabbing" condition), the background image in the
canvas must shift following the mouse movements

Muzietto: use the upload script to upload the project as it is now
