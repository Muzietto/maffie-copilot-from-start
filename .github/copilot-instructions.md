# Copilot instructions for contributors / AI agents

Purpose
- Help an AI coding agent quickly become productive in this repository.

Repo snapshot
- Name: `maffie-copilot-from-start` (owner: Muzietto, branch: main).
- Current contents: minimal skeleton (LICENSE, `README.md` only).

What to do first (mandatory discovery steps)
1. Inventory the repo root for language/runtime manifests and CI files. Look for these files (case-sensitive):
   - `package.json`, `package-lock.json`, `pnpm-lock.yaml` (Node)
   - `pyproject.toml`, `requirements.txt`, `setup.py` (Python)
   - `go.mod` (Go), `pom.xml` (Java/Maven), `build.gradle` (Gradle)
   - `.github/workflows/*` for CI steps and environment hints
   Example PowerShell discovery command:
   ```powershell
   Get-ChildItem -Recurse -File -Include package.json,pyproject.toml,go.mod,pom.xml,build.gradle,*.sln
   ```

2. If a manifest exists, run the minimal install/test smoke commands for that ecosystem on Windows PowerShell:
   - Node: `npm ci; npm test` (or `pnpm install; pnpm test`)
   - Python: `python -m pip install -r requirements.txt; pytest -q`
   Run only after the manifest is present; don't assume any package manager.

How this repo currently differs from typical projects
- There are no source folders or manifests yet. Prioritize discovery and ask the human owner for the intended language/runtime before scaffolding.

When modifying or scaffolding code
- Ask for a target language or framework if not present. If the user asks you to implement a feature, propose a small scaffold (source dir, manifest, minimal test) and wait for approval.
- Keep changes minimal and self-contained. Add or update a manifest (e.g., `package.json`, `pyproject.toml`) when adding runnable code.

Testing & verification
- Prefer to add a tiny automated test for any new behavior (1 happy-path). Run the test locally after changes and include the test output in the PR description.

Files to reference for repository-specific patterns
- `README.md` — currently empty; update it with run/build instructions if you add code.
- `LICENSE` — preserve.

When to ask the human
- If the repo is empty like now, ask: "Which language/runtime should I use? Do you want a minimal scaffold (build, test)?"
- Ask for credentials or external service access if an integration requires them — never proceed without explicit human approval.

Minimal contract for agent changes
- Inputs: files added or edited in this repo.
- Outputs: runnable scaffold or feature with one test and updated README.
- Error modes: build/test failures — include failing output and stop.

Edge cases to watch for
- Multiple manifests (e.g., mono-repo): confirm which package to work on.
- CI that installs extra system packages — read `.github/workflows` closely before mirroring locally.

If you update this file
- Merge any existing human-written guidance instead of overwriting. Keep human phrasing and intentions when they exist.

If anything here is unclear, ask a short clarifying question before making changes.
